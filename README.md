## Synopsis

Machine Learning project for the [Digit Recognizer competition in Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer).

This project doesn't use the full MNIST dataset, only the part provided by the Kaggle competition.

The algorithm current accuracy for the competition is 0.99414.

## Installation

Requirements.txt contains the packages to install with pip. I have only tested it on Python 3, no guarantees it will work for Python 2.

## Project structure

The project can be executed through 'main.py', which imports 'utils.py', or as a single script with 'script.py'. This last script can be found and executed [in Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/fray88/cnn-for-mnist-script).
